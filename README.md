# Face Similarity Detection Using PCA

## Project Overview
This project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to detect similarities among faces in a dataset of grayscale images. By reducing dimensionality, PCA helps in identifying patterns that signify facial similarities, facilitating efficient comparison across different images.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations, especially for matrix operations involved in PCA.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing faces and PCA results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For PCA implementation and other preprocessing steps.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of grayscale facial images used to train the PCA model to recognize and compare facial features effectively.

## Model Description
PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the face images while retaining the most significant features necessary for comparison. This reduction not only simplifies the data but also speeds up the computation without losing critical information essential for detecting similarities.
